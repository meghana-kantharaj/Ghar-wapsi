A developing website to ease integration of a new immigrants life into the culture of an Indian city.

This website was inspired by my uncle’s family, including kids aged 5 and 10 moved to their native city in India. Having been away from it for 20 years, they found it hard to cope with the pressures of maintaining jobs, responsibilities of their kids education, moving across countries. Moving to a new city generally marks a new life, and can be very exciting! But that is when you have the time, flexibility and no immediate responsibilities to settle in. 

Every city has it’s own essence, it’s culture which makes it a beautiful experience. It needs to be understood and experience to be loved. Most times new immigrants find it hard to adjust and understand, and most times end up not living the city for its worth. 
This website comes to use to bridge the gap between new immigrants, looking to get accepted by the city and the city, looking to be loved by its inhabitants, after all, happiness is what motivates growth. Check out the readme_ghar_wapsi.txt for more information on the contents.
